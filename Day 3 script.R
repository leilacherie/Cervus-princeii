# Github training

# Hi Leyla, what are you doing?

# To add to Github, click tick box next to folder in Git tab
# To commit, press commit button

mydata <-read.csv("")

# When you change something and press save an 'M' in a blue box appears = modified
# Put tick next to script file, new button appears: Diff shows you the modifications made
# Then commit it
# Then push your code to Github - top right arrow in box

# remember your password for Github! 

# gitignore
# can tell git what to ignore (e.g. large files, PDFs, Word docs, xls. etc)
# these files are too big and too big to commit
# changes made can't be seen or highlighted

# what you should and shouldn't commit
# code mainly
# should commit regularly in chunks rather than at the end of each day
# small simple files only (not, see above)

I love buscuits
